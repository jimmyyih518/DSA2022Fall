'''
Unique numbers in array
Given a sorted array nums, find all unique elements in array.
The total number of elements in the array is much larger than the number of unique elements in the array.
Constraint: Must solve in less than O(n) time where n is number of elements in array
You may use any algorithm or data structure youâ€™ve learnt so far
